# Social-Network

For this assignment, I was tasked with creating updating, and deleting users and thoughts inside Insomnia. It was a fun assignment as I got to learn a lot about Insomnia. In my video, I showed how to create your user, update the user, delete the user, create and find your thoughts by ID or by all of them. I also showed how to find all users by ID or just all of them together. I also explained how to delete specific users. Code source is from me but I also reviewed a past activity from class to help me out with some missing routes.
